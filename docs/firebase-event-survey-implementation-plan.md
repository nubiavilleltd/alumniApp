# Firebase Event Survey Implementation Plan

## Purpose

This document explains the safest way to move the event survey / registration-form feature out of `localStorage` and into Firebase without changing the app's existing authentication flow.

This plan assumes:

- the main app auth stays exactly as it is today
- Firebase is used only for event survey forms and survey responses
- Firestore is **not** exposed directly to the browser
- the browser talks to Cloud Functions
- Cloud Functions verify the existing app bearer token, then read/write Firestore with the Admin SDK

This is designed to be safe enough for a temporary solution and stable enough if it becomes long-term.

## Current Frontend Source Of Truth

The current survey prototype behavior already exists in:

- `src/features/events/pages/CreateEventPage.tsx`
- `src/features/events/components/EventRegistrationFormBuilderModal.tsx`
- `src/features/events/components/RegisterEventModal.tsx`
- `src/features/events/lib/eventRegistrationFormStorage.ts`
- `src/features/events/types/eventRegistrationForm.types.ts`

## Recommended Architecture

### Keep these as they are

- existing login flow
- existing app backend
- existing bearer token handling in the frontend
- existing event APIs

### Add these

1. Firebase project
2. Firestore database
3. Cloud Functions for survey read/write operations
4. Firebase App Check in the frontend
5. server-side verification of the existing bearer token inside Cloud Functions

## Why this is the safest version

If the browser writes directly to Firestore, Firestore has no built-in understanding of the app's current login system.

That means direct browser writes would force us to either:

- trust client-provided `userId`, `role`, or `eventId`, which is risky
- or migrate auth logic into Firebase Auth, which is more work and changes the system shape

Using Cloud Functions avoids that. The browser remains untrusted. Firestore stays private.

## Security Model

### Browser can do

- fetch forms for an event
- submit its own answers
- call admin form-management endpoints if the verified user is an admin

### Browser cannot do

- read Firestore directly
- write Firestore directly
- choose its own trusted `userId`
- choose its own trusted `role`

### Cloud Functions must do

- verify Firebase App Check token
- verify the app's bearer token
- derive the real `userId` and `role`
- validate form definitions
- validate survey answers
- write Firestore using the Admin SDK

## Firestore Structure

Use nested collections under the event so all survey data stays grouped by event.

### 1. `events/{eventId}/surveyForms/{formId}`

Represents one logical form attached to an event.

Suggested fields:

- `eventId`
- `name`
- `sortOrder`
- `isActive`
- `activeVersionId`
- `activeVersionNumber`
- `activeSnapshot`
- `hasSubmissions`
- `createdBy`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `updatedBy`

Example:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "name": "Food Preferences",
  "sortOrder": 1,
  "isActive": true,
  "activeVersionId": "v3",
  "activeVersionNumber": 3,
  "activeSnapshot": {
    "name": "Food Preferences",
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": "q1",
        "label": "Preferred meal",
        "type": "dropdown",
        "required": true,
        "placeholder": "Select a meal",
        "options": ["Rice", "Pasta", "Salad"],
        "order": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "hasSubmissions": true,
  "createdBy": "39",
  "createdAt": "serverTimestamp",
  "updatedAt": "serverTimestamp",
  "updatedBy": "39"
}
```

### 2. `events/{eventId}/surveyForms/{formId}/versions/{versionId}`

Represents an immutable version of a form.

Suggested fields:

- `versionNumber`
- `name`
- `sortOrder`
- `questions`
- `createdBy`
- `createdAt`
- `status`

Example:

```json
{
  "versionNumber": 3,
  "name": "Food Preferences",
  "sortOrder": 1,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "label": "Preferred meal",
      "type": "dropdown",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Select a meal",
      "options": ["Rice", "Pasta", "Salad"],
      "order": 1
    }
  ],
  "createdBy": "39",
  "createdAt": "serverTimestamp",
  "status": "published"
}
```

### 3. `events/{eventId}/surveyRegistrations/{userId}`

Represents one user's survey submission for one event.

Use `userId` as the document ID so uniqueness is automatic per event.

Suggested fields:

- `eventId`
- `userId`
- `userName`
- `userEmail`
- `rsvpStatus`
- `additionalInfo`
- `submittedAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `formVersions`
- `answers`

Example:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "userId": "55",
  "userName": "Jane Doe",
  "userEmail": "jane@example.com",
  "rsvpStatus": "going",
  "additionalInfo": "I may arrive late.",
  "submittedAt": "serverTimestamp",
  "updatedAt": "serverTimestamp",
  "formVersions": [
    {
      "formId": "formA",
      "formVersionId": "v3",
      "formVersionNumber": 3,
      "formName": "Food Preferences"
    }
  ],
  "answers": [
    {
      "formId": "formA",
      "formVersionId": "v3",
      "questionId": "q1",
      "questionLabel": "Preferred meal",
      "questionType": "dropdown",
      "order": 1,
      "required": true,
      "value": "Rice"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why this data model is good

- active forms are fast to read because `activeSnapshot` is ready for the frontend
- form version history is immutable
- historical answers remain stable after form edits
- admin review is easy because answers already contain snapshots
- event survey data is isolated from the rest of the app

## Firestore Rules

Make Firestore private. Cloud Functions should be the only access path.

```txt
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

This is the safest rule set for this architecture.

## Cloud Functions To Build

Use HTTPS functions, not direct Firestore access from the frontend.

### Shared helper requirements for every function

Every function should:

1. verify Firebase App Check
2. verify the existing app bearer token
3. fetch the real user profile
4. derive `userId` and `role` from trusted server-side data

### Function 1. `getEventSurveyForms`

Purpose:

- fetch all active forms for an event

Who can call it:

- any authenticated user

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "forms": [
    {
      "id": "formA",
      "name": "Food Preferences",
      "sortOrder": 1,
      "version": 3,
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "q1",
          "label": "Preferred meal",
          "type": "dropdown",
          "required": true,
          "placeholder": "Select a meal",
          "options": ["Rice", "Pasta", "Salad"],
          "order": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Function 2. `upsertEventSurveyForm`

Purpose:

- create a new form
- update an existing form
- always publish a new version

Who can call it:

- admin only

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "formId": "formA",
  "name": "Food Preferences",
  "sortOrder": 1,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "label": "Preferred meal",
      "type": "dropdown",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Select a meal",
      "options": ["Rice", "Pasta", "Salad"],
      "order": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Required behavior:

- validate the form
- if `formId` does not exist, create it
- if `formId` exists, create a new version
- update the parent form document's `activeVersionId`, `activeVersionNumber`, and `activeSnapshot`

### Function 3. `archiveEventSurveyForm`

Purpose:

- deactivate a form

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "formId": "formA"
}
```

Required behavior:

- soft archive only
- set `isActive` to `false`
- do not hard-delete old versions

### Function 4. `reorderEventSurveyForms`

Purpose:

Who can call it:

- admin only

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "forms": [
    { "formId": "formA", "sortOrder": 1 },
    { "formId": "formB", "sortOrder": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Required behavior:

- update only `sortOrder`
- keep versions unchanged

### Function 5. `submitEventSurveyRegistration`

Purpose:

- save one user's answers for one event

Who can call it:

- authenticated user

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "rsvpStatus": "going",
  "additionalInfo": "I may arrive late.",
  "answers": [
    {
      "formId": "formA",
      "questionId": "q1",
      "value": "Rice"
    }
  ]
}
```

Required behavior:

- load current active forms for the event
- validate answers against the active forms
- capture form version info and question snapshots
- write one registration document at `events/{eventId}/surveyRegistrations/{userId}`
- use a transaction

### Function 6. `getEventSurveySubmissions`

Purpose:

- fetch survey submission list for admins

Who can call it:

- admin only

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123"
}
```

Response should include:

- `userId`
- `userName`
- `userEmail`
- `rsvpStatus`
- `submittedAt`
- `updatedAt`

### Function 7. `getEventSurveySubmissionDetail`

Purpose:

- fetch one user's full survey submission for admin review

Who can call it:

Request:

```json
{
  "eventId": "123",
  "userId": "55"
}
```

Response should include:

- registration summary
- form version metadata
- answers in saved order

## Shared Validation Rules

### Form validation

- form name is required
- form must contain at least one question
- question label is required
- question `type` must be one of:
  - `short_answer`
  - `long_answer`
  - `multiple_choice`
  - `checkbox`
  - `dropdown`
- choice-based types must have at least 2 options
- `order` must be explicit

### Answer validation

- required questions must have a value
- `multiple_choice` must match one allowed option
- `dropdown` must match one allowed option
- `checkbox` must contain only allowed options
- `short_answer` and `long_answer` can be strings

## Function Helper Modules To Create

These helpers will keep the Cloud Functions code clean.

### `verifyAppCheck`

Purpose:

- verify App Check token on every request

### `verifyExistingBearerToken`

Purpose:

- verify the app's current bearer token

Recommended behavior:

- read the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header
- call the existing backend user/profile endpoint or a dedicated token-verification endpoint
- reject if invalid
- return trusted user data

### `requireAdmin`

Purpose:

- reject non-admin users for admin-only functions

### `validateSurveyForm`

Purpose:

- validate form structure before save

### `validateSurveyAnswers`

Purpose:

- validate user answers against active forms

### `buildAnswerSnapshots`

Purpose:

- convert raw answers into stored answer rows with:
  - `formVersionId`
  - `questionLabel`
  - `questionType`
  - `order`
  - `required`

### `writeSurveyRegistrationTransaction`

Purpose:

- transactionally save or update a user's submission

## Suggested Cloud Functions Folder Shape

```txt
functions/
  src/
    index.ts
    config/
      firebase.ts
    middleware/
      verifyAppCheck.ts
      verifyExistingBearerToken.ts
      requireAdmin.ts
    survey/
      getEventSurveyForms.ts

        validateSurveyAnswers.ts
      utils/
        buildAnswerSnapshots.ts
        writeSurveyRegistrationTransaction.ts
```

## Frontend Changes Needed

The frontend should stop reading and writing survey data from `localStorage`.

### Replace these responsibilities

Current local storage behavior in:

- `src/features/events/lib/eventRegistrationFormStorage.ts`

Should be replaced with API calls to the new Cloud Functions.

### Frontend integration targets

1. `CreateEventPage.tsx`
   - load saved forms from Firebase
   - save create/update form actions to Firebase

2. `EventRegistrationFormBuilderModal.tsx`
   - send create/update requests to Firebase functions

3. `RegisterEventModal.tsx`
   - fetch forms from Firebase
   - submit answers to Firebase

4. `eventRegistrationForm.types.ts`
   - keep types aligned with Firebase payloads

## Step-By-Step Implementation Order

This is the order to start in.

### Step 1. Set up Firebase

- create Firebase project
- enable Firestore
- enable Cloud Functions
- enable App Check for web

### Step 2. Lock Firestore down

- deploy deny-all Firestore rules
- confirm browser cannot read/write Firestore directly

### Step 3. Create Cloud Functions project

- initialize Firebase Functions
- add Admin SDK access
- add TypeScript if not already using it

### Step 4. Implement shared middleware

Build these first:

- `verifyAppCheck`
- `verifyExistingBearerToken`
- `requireAdmin`

Do not build survey functions before these are working.

### Step 5. Implement form read endpoint

Build `getEventSurveyForms` first because the frontend needs it to stop relying on local storage.

### Step 6. Implement admin form management endpoints

Build:

- `upsertEventSurveyForm`
- `archiveEventSurveyForm`
- `reorderEventSurveyForms`

### Step 7. Implement user submission endpoint

Build:

- `submitEventSurveyRegistration`

Use Firestore transactions here.

### Step 8. Implement admin reporting endpoints

Build:

- `getEventSurveySubmissions`
- `getEventSurveySubmissionDetail`

### Step 9. Switch frontend off local storage

- replace form definition storage
- replace user answer storage
- keep current UI behavior the same

### Step 10. Remove old local storage fallback

Once Firebase flow is stable:

- remove local storage persistence
- remove temporary text serialization into `additional_info` if no longer needed

## Immediate Build Checklist

This is the fastest safe starting sequence for right now.

### Today

1. create Firebase project
2. enable Firestore
3. initialize Cloud Functions
4. deploy deny-all Firestore rules
5. scaffold middleware helpers

### Next

1. build `getEventSurveyForms`
2. build `upsertEventSurveyForm`
3. connect `CreateEventPage.tsx` and the form builder

### After that

1. build `submitEventSurveyRegistration`
2. connect `RegisterEventModal.tsx`
3. add admin submission review endpoints

## Risks To Avoid

Do not do these:

- do not let the browser read Firestore directly
- do not let the browser write Firestore directly
- do not trust client-provided `userId`
- do not trust client-provided `role`
- do not hard-delete forms or versions after submissions exist
- do not mutate historical versions in place
- do not use permissive Firestore rules

## Long-Term Recommendation

Even if this starts as a fallback, build it like it may stay.

That means:

- Cloud Functions only
- private Firestore
- explicit versioning
- transactional writes
- strict validation
- admin-only management paths

If this is implemented in that shape, it can remain in production safely for much longer than a quick temporary hack.
